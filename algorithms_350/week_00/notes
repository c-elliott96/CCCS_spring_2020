quiz Friday:
     1) string length
     2) substring
     	a) longest common substring
	   return z such that z is a substring of x and z is a
	   substring of y AND z is maximized subject to x and y

	   for this problem, use TWO (read, 3 or 4)double for loops to
	   break apart the two stings into all their respective substrings

	b) palindromes
	   "madamimadam"
	   bool is_palindrome(const char x[])

     3) 240 basic algorithms
     	- swap function
	- max of array
	- min of array
	- int linear search of array (int x[], int len, int target)
	  --> find 1st index where target is found in x[]
	- int bubble sort (int x[], int len)
	- int binary search (int x[], int len, int target)
