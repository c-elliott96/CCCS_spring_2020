[A-Z,a-z,_]+([0-9,A-Z,a-z,_]*)?

let digit = ['0'-'9']             # one digit only
let digits = digit +              # accepts 1 or more digits
let lower_letters = ['a'-'z']     # one lowercase letter only
let upper_letters = ['A'-'Z']     # one uppercase letter only
let letter = upper_letters | lower_letters     # one upper or lower case letter
let letters = letter +     # 1 or more upper or lower case letter
